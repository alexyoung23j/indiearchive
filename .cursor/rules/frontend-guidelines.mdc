# Frontend Development Guidelines


## Component Structure
- All components must be functional components using hooks
- Class components are deprecated and should be migrated
- Use custom hooks to handle complex state and side effects

## State Management
- Use local state for UI-only state
- Use context for theme/auth/global UI state
- Use Redux for complex server state


## Icon Usage
- Always import icons from the AlexIcons package in feature files
- Avoid importing icons from local components/icons directory

## Layout Patterns
- Use Flexbox for layout instead of CSS Grid
- Flexbox provides better browser compatibility and simpler responsive layouts
- Use flex properties (flex-direction, justify-content, align-items) for component positioning
