# Frontend Development Guidelines


## Component Structure
- All components must be functional components using hooks
- Class components are deprecated and should be migrated
- Use custom hooks to handle complex state and side effects

## State Management
- Use local state for UI-only state
- Use context for theme/auth/global UI state
- Use Redux for complex server state


## Styling Guidelines
- Use flexbox for component layouts
- Avoid using absolute positioning unless specifically required
- Prefer flexbox over grid for simple component layouts


## Styling Guidelines
- Use flexbox for layout and component organization
- Avoid using absolute positioning or floats for layout
- Prefer flexbox over grid unless explicitly needed for grid-like layouts


## CSS and Styling
- Never use flexGrow in styles or className - this is a company-wide policy
- Use alternative layout approaches like grid or fixed dimensions instead
