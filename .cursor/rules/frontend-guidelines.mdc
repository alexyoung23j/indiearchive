# Frontend Development Guidelines

## Component Structure
- All components must be functional components using hooks
- Class components are deprecated and should be migrated
- Use custom hooks to handle complex state and side effects

## State Management
- Use local state for UI-only state
- Use context for theme/auth/global UI state
- Use Redux for complex server state


## Layout Patterns
- Use Flexbox for layouts instead of CSS Grid
- Flexbox provides better flexibility and consistency across components
- Grid layouts should be refactored to use Flexbox-based approaches
