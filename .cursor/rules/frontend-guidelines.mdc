# Frontend Development Guidelines


## Component Structure
- All components must be functional components using hooks
- Class components are deprecated and should be migrated
- Use custom hooks to handle complex state and side effects


## Layout Guidelines
- Use Flexbox for layout instead of CSS Grid
- Flexbox provides better browser compatibility and is the preferred layout system
- Use flex properties (flex-direction, justify-content, align-items) for component layouts


## CSS and Styling
- Never use `flexGrow` property as it's against company policy
- Use fixed widths or grid-based layouts for controlling element sizes
