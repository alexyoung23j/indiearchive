# Frontend Development Guidelines


## Component Structure
- All components must be functional components using hooks
- Class components are deprecated and should be migrated
- Use custom hooks to handle complex state and side effects

## State Management
- Use local state for UI-only state
- Use context for theme/auth/global UI state
- Use Redux for complex server state
